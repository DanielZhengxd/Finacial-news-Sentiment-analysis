Sentiment analysis has become an increasingly important task in finance, as it allows investors, analysts, and policymakers to better understand the sentiments and opinions people express about companies, financial instruments, and economic trends. Analyzing the sentiment of financial news articles can provide valuable insights that complement traditional financial analysis, leading to more informed investment decisions and risk management strategies.
